***IMPORTANT***

On /frontend/src/app.js - line 10:

- Change the HOST constant value to the IP of the machine that's running the node server.

**DO NOT** type "localhost", you wont be able to use the app outside of the machine that hosts the node server

# Instructions:
open a terminal window
```
cd PATH_TO_PROJECT/backend
npm i
node server.js
```

open another terminal window
```
cd PATH_TO_PROJECT/frontend
npm i
npm start
```

Enjoy the game!
